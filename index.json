However, generating music conditioned on textual descriptions, known as text-to-music, remains challenging due to the complexity of musical structures and high sampling rate requirements.

This paper introduces JEN-1, a universal high-fidelity model for text-to-music generation. JEN-1 is a diffusion model incorporating both autoregressive and non-autoregressive training. Through incontext learning, JEN-1 performs various generation tasks including text-guided music generation, music inpainting, and continuation.

In contrast, for untrimmed videos, the sound duration, start- and endsounding time positions, and visual deformation of audible objects vary significantly. Therefore, we observed that current AVS models trained on trimmed videos might struggle to segment sounding objects in long videos. To investigate the feasibility of grounding audible objects in videos along both temporal and spatial dimensions, we introduce the Long-Untrimmed Audio-Visual Segmentation dataset (LU-AVS), which includes precise frame-level annotations of sounding emission times and provides exhaustive mask annotations for all frames. Considering that pixel-level annotations are difficult to achieve in some complex scenes, we also provide the bounding boxes to indicate the sounding regions. Specifically, LU-AVS contains 10M mask annotations across 6.6K videos, and 11M bounding box annotations across 7K videos. Compared with the existing datasets, LUAVS videos are on average 4∼8 times longer, with the silent duration being 3∼15 times greater. Furthermore, we try our best to adapt some baseline models that were originally designed for audio-visual-relevant tasks to examine the challenges of our newly curated LU-AVS. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate the challenges of LU-AVS compared to the ones containing trimmed videos. Therefore, LU-AVS provides an ideal yet challenging platform for evaluating audio-visual segmentation and localization on untrimmed long videos.

Existing works mainly focus on fusing audio and visual features of a given video to achieve sounding object masks. However, we observed that prior arts are prone to segment a certain salient object in a video regardless of the audio information. This is because sounding objects are often the most salient ones in the AVS dataset. Thus, current AVS methods might fail to localize genuine sounding objects due to the dataset bias. In this work, we present an audio-visual instance-aware segmentation approach to overcome the dataset bias. In a nutshell, our method first localizes potential sounding objects in a video by an object segmentation network, and then associates the sounding object candidates with the given audio. We notice that an object could be a sounding object in one video but a silent one in another video. This would bring ambiguity in training our object segmentation network as only sounding objects have corresponding segmentation masks. We thus propose a silent object-aware segmentation objective to alleviate the ambiguity. Moreover, since the category information of audio is unknown, especially for multiple sounding sources, we propose to explore the audio-visual semantic correlation and then associate audio with potential objects. Specifically, we attend predicted audio category scores to potential instance masks and these scores will highlight corresponding sounding instances while suppressing inaudible ones. When we enforce the attended instance masks to resemble the ground-truth mask, we are able to establish audio-visual semantics correlation. Experimental results on the AVS benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively segment sounding objects without being biased to salient objects.

However, the  high storage overhead of video sequences largely stems the applications of V-Re-ID. To reduce the storage overhead, we propose to represent each video sequence with only one frame. However, directly picking one frame from each sequence will dramatically decrease the performance. Thus, we propose a brand-new framework called super frame generation network (SFGN) which can encode the spatial-temporal information of a video sequence into a generated frame, which is called super frame to distinguish from the directly picked key frame. To achieve super frames of high visual quality and representation ability, we carefully design the specific-frame-feature fused skip-connection generator (SFSG). SFSG takes the role of a feature encoder and the co-trained image model can be seen as the corresponding feature decoder. To reduce the information loss in the encoding-decoding process, we further propose the feature recovery loss (FRL). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose and relieve this issue. Extensive experiments on Mars, iLIDS-VID and PRID2011 show that the proposed SFGN can generate super frames of high visual quality and representation ability.

However, it is exponentially challenging to enumerate, collect, and then annotate all object categories in the real open-world scenario. To eliminate such limitations, we propose a realistic yet challenging task, namely Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation (OVPS), which can segment novel categories by exploiting only the natural language text prompts without needing any mask annotations. We propose a framework called Multi-Modal Meta-Knowledge Transferring (M3KT) to panoptically segment the novel categories with zero-shot training samples. By decoupling the grouping and recognition, M3KT effectively generates visual meta-weights for each class-agnostic object. By enforcing the similarity of visual meta-weights and textual meta-weights, M3KT gradually adapts the semantic prior knowledge from the language domain to the vision domain. In this way, M3KT learns localization and recognition ability trained on the seen base categories, and able to generalize on unseen novel categories described by the open-vocabulary text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed M3KT network evaluated on COCO-Panoptic benchmark. Our proposed M3KT also shows strong generalization ability on novel categories when evaluated on the cross-domain benchmarks from COCO-Panoptic dataset to Cityscapes-Panoptic dataset.

Due to different lighting conditions and imaging hardware, domain gaps between training and testing images inevitably occur in many real-world scenarios. Neglecting those domain gaps would lead to inferior face super-resolution (FSR) performance. However, collecting large-scale data from a target domain to re-train FSR models is often time-consuming. Therefore, we aim to employ only few examples, ideally one-shot exemplar, to adapt an FSR model to a target domain rapidly. In this paper, we propose a domain-aware pyramid-based face super-resolution network, named DAP-FSR network, to super-resolve LR faces from a new domain by exploiting one paired high-resolution (HR) and LR exemplar in the target domain. When a target domain LR face is given, our DAP-FSR firstly employs its encoder extracts the multi-scale latent representations of the input face. Considering only one target domain example is available, we augment the target domain data by mixing the latent representations of the target domain face and source domain ones, and then feed the mixed representations to the decoder of our DAP-FSR. The decoder will generate new face images resembling the given target domain image. The generated HR faces in return are used to optimize our decoder to reduce the domain gap. By iteratively updating the latent representations and our decoder, our DAP-FSR will be adapted to the target domain, thus achieving authentic and high-quality upsampled HR faces. Extensive experiments on three newly constructed benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superior performance of our proposed DAP-FSR compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

The ambiguous boundary between different semantic parts and those categories with similar appearance usually are confusing, leading to unexpected noises in ground truth masks. To tackle the problem of learning with label noises, this work introduces a purification strategy, called Self-Correction for Human Parsing (SCHP), to progressively promote the reliability of the supervised labels as well as the learned models. In particular, starting from a model trained with inaccurate annotations as initialization, we design a cyclically learning scheduler to infer more reliable pseudo-masks by iteratively aggregating the current learned model with the former optimal one in an online manner. Besides, those correspondingly corrected labels can in turn to further boost the model performance. In this way, the models and the labels will reciprocally become more robust and accurate during the self-correction learning cycles. Benefiting from the superiority of SCHP, we achieve the best performance on two popular single-person human parsing benchmarks, including LIP and Pascal-Person-Part datasets.

Previous practice [1] proposed to train the classifiers for unseen categories using the visual features generated from semantic word embeddings. However, the generator is merely learned on the seen categories while no constraint is applied to the unseen categories, leading to poor generalization ability. In this work, we propose a Consistent Structural Relation Learning (CSRL) approach to constrain the generating of unseen visual features by exploiting the structural relations between seen and unseen categories. We observe that different categories are usually with similar relations in either semantic word embedding space or visual feature space. This observation motivates us to harness the similarity of category-level relations on the semantic word embedding space to learn a better visual feature generator. Concretely, by exploring the pair-wise and list-wise structures, we impose the relations of generated visual features to be consistent with their counterparts in the semantic word embedding space. In this way, the relations between seen and unseen categories will be transferred to implicitly constrain the generator to produce relation-consistent unseen visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context benchmarks. The proposed CSRL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, resulting in ~7-12% on Pascal-VOC and ~2-5% on Pascal-Context.

Our mission is to study a generalizable and robust segmentation network from the meta-learning perspective so that both seen and unseen categories can be correctly recognized. Different from previous practices, this task performs segmentation on a joint label space consisting of both previously seen and novel categories. Moreover, pixels from these multiple categories need to be simultaneously taken into account, which is actually not well explored before. Accordingly, we present Meta Parsing Networks (MPNet) to better exploit the guidance information in the support set. Our MPNet contains two basic modules, i.e., the Adaptive Deep Metric Learning (ADML) module and the Contrastive Inter-class Distraction (CID) module. Specially, the ADML takes the annotated pixels from the support image as the guidance and adaptively produces high-quality prototypes for learning a deep comparison metric. In addition, MPNet further introduces the CID module learning to enlarge the feature discrepancy of different categories in the embedding space, leading the MPNet to generate more discriminative feature embeddings.

However, due to the different pose, occlusion, misalignment and multi-granularity in video sequences, those consequent inter-sequence variations and intra-sequence variations, inevitably makes the feature learning and matching in videos more difficult. Under this circumstance, it is necessary to design an effective discriminative representation learning mechanism, as well as a matching solution, to tackle these variations in video-based person re-ID. To this end, this paper introduces a multi-granularity temporal convolution network and a mutual distance matching measurement, aiming at alleviating the intra-sequence variation and the inter-sequence variation, respectively. Particularly, in the feature learning stage, we model different temporal granularities by hierarchically stacking temporal convolution blocks with different dilation factors. In the feature matching stage, we propose a clip-level probe-gallery mutual distance measurement and consider the most convincing clip pairs by top-k selection. We validate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results on three video-based person re-ID benchmarks, more than that, we conduct extensive ablation study to demonstrate conciseness and effectiveness of our method in video re-ID tasks.","tags":[],"title":"Hierarchical Temporal Modeling with Mutual Distance Matching for Video Based Person Re-Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Music generation has attracted growing interest with the advancement of deep generative models. However, generating music conditioned on textual descriptions, known as text-to-music, remains challenging due to the complexity of musical structures and high sampling rate requirements. Despite the task\u0026rsquo;s significance, prevailing generative models exhibit limitations in music quality, computational efficiency, and generalization. This paper introduces JEN-1, a universal high-fidelity model for text-to-music generation. JEN-1 is a diffusion model incorporating both autoregressive and non-autoregressive training. Through in-context learning, JEN-1 performs various generation tasks including text-guided music generation, music inpainting, and continuation. Evaluations demonstrate JEN-1\u0026rsquo;s superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in text-music alignment and music quality while maintaining computational efficiency.

LIP challenge has attracted many world-famous AI companies and universities including the ByteDance AI Lab, JD AI Lab, Samsung AI Lab UCLA, Cambridge and so on.\nLIP Challenge is co-organized with workshop on augmented human: human-centric understanding. The workshop is co-located with CVPR 2019, the most important annual computer vision conference, to be held in Long Beach, California 16-23 June. The goal of this workshop is to allow researchers from the fields of human-centric understanding and 2D/3D synthesis to present their progress, communication and co-develop novel ideas that potentially shape the future of this area and further advance the performance and applicability of correspondingly built systems in real-world conditions.\nThe results can be found in https://vuhcs.github.io/.\n  Award Certificate    Award Certificate    Award Certificate   The third large-scale Look Into Person (LIP) challenges which include five competition tasks: the single-person human parsing, the single-person pose estimation, the multi-person human parsing, multi-person video parsing, multi-person pose estimation benchmark, and clothes virtual try-on benchmark. This third LIP challenge mainly extends the second LIP challenge in CVPR 2017 and CVPR 2018 by additionally covering a video human parsing challenge and the 2D/3D clothes virtual try-on benchmark. For the single-person human parsing and pose estimation, 50,000 images with elaborated pixel-wise annotations with comprehensive 19 semantic human part labels and 2D human poses with 16 dense key points are provided. For the multi-person human parsing competition task, another 50000 images of crowded scenes with 19 semantic human part labels are provided. For video-based human parsing, 3000 video shots with 1-2 minutes will be densely annotated with 19 semantic human part labels. For multi-person pose estimation, the dataset contains 25,828 images with 2D human poses with 16 dense key points and head \u0026amp; instance bounding boxes. The new image-based clothes try-on benchmark targets at fitting new in-shop clothes into a person image and generate one try-on video to show different clothes viewpoints on the person. The images collected from the real-world scenarios contain humans appearing with challenging poses and views, heavily occlusions, various appearances and low-resolutions. This challenge was released before January, 2019 and the challenge is conjunction with CVPR 2019, Long Beach, CA.\nHuman Parsing is the sub-task of semantic segmentation which need to assign a semantic label (like leg or arm) to each pixel in a human image. We proposed a novel SPHP(Single Person Human Parsing) network, which consists of three key modules to learn for parsing in an end-to-end manner including high resolution embedding module, global context embedding module and edge perceiving module.\n  Single Person Parsing Visualization    Multiple Person Parsing Visualization    Video Multiple Person Parsing Visualization   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601079773,"objectID":"77e35d9fb208659a988c4f9f76cb932d","permalink":"https://peikeli.github.io/competitions/cvpr2019-lip-challenge/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/competitions/cvpr2019-lip-challenge/","section":"competitions","summary":":trophy:Winner of single-person human parsing (Track1), multi-person human parsing (Track3) and multi-person video human parsing (Track4).","tags":["Competition"],"title":"CVPR2019 LIP Challenge 1st Place","type":"competitions"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601079773,"objectID":"73c43e7c32a094f1e5e7e420d4e1dec8","permalink":"https://peikeli.github.io/competitions/iccv2019-youtube-vos-challenge/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/competitions/iccv2019-youtube-vos-challenge/","section":"competitions","summary":":trophy:Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (Track 1) \u0026 Video Instance Segmentation Task (Track 2)","tags":["Competition"],"title":"ICCV2019 Youtube-VOS Challenge 3rd Place","type":"competitions"}]

However, the  high storage overhead of video sequences largely stems the applications of V-Re-ID. To reduce the storage overhead, we propose to represent each video sequence with only one frame. However, directly picking one frame from each sequence will dramatically decrease the performance. Thus, we propose a brand-new framework called super frame generation network (SFGN) which can encode the spatial-temporal information of a video sequence into a generated frame, which is called super frame to distinguish from the directly picked key frame. To achieve super frames of high visual quality and representation ability, we carefully design the specific-frame-feature fused skip-connection generator (SFSG). SFSG takes the role of a feature encoder and the co-trained image model can be seen as the corresponding feature decoder. To reduce the information loss in the encoding-decoding process, we further propose the feature recovery loss (FRL). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose and relieve this issue. Extensive experiments on Mars, iLIDS-VID and PRID2011 show that the proposed SFGN can generate super frames of high visual quality and representation ability.

However, it is exponentially challenging to enumerate, collect, and then annotate all object categories in the real open-world scenario. To eliminate such limitations, we propose a realistic yet challenging task, namely Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation (OVPS), which can segment novel categories by exploiting only the natural language text prompts without needing any mask annotations. We propose a framework called Multi-Modal Meta-Knowledge Transferring (M3KT) to panoptically segment the novel categories with zero-shot training samples. By decoupling the grouping and recognition, M3KT effectively generates visual meta-weights for each class-agnostic object. By enforcing the similarity of visual meta-weights and textual meta-weights, M3KT gradually adapts the semantic prior knowledge from the language domain to the vision domain. In this way, M3KT learns localization and recognition ability trained on the seen base categories, and able to generalize on unseen novel categories described by the open-vocabulary text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed M3KT network evaluated on COCO-Panoptic benchmark. Our proposed M3KT also shows strong generalization ability on novel categories when evaluated on the cross-domain benchmarks from COCO-Panoptic dataset to Cityscapes-Panoptic dataset.

Due to different lighting conditions and imaging hardware, domain gaps between training and testing images inevitably occur in many real-world scenarios. Neglecting those domain gaps would lead to inferior face super-resolution (FSR) performance. However, collecting large-scale data from a target domain to re-train FSR models is often time-consuming. Therefore, we aim to employ only few examples, ideally one-shot exemplar, to adapt an FSR model to a target domain rapidly. In this paper, we propose a domain-aware pyramid-based face super-resolution network, named DAP-FSR network, to super-resolve LR faces from a new domain by exploiting one paired high-resolution (HR) and LR exemplar in the target domain. When a target domain LR face is given, our DAP-FSR firstly employs its encoder extracts the multi-scale latent representations of the input face. Considering only one target domain example is available, we augment the target domain data by mixing the latent representations of the target domain face and source domain ones, and then feed the mixed representations to the decoder of our DAP-FSR. The decoder will generate new face images resembling the given target domain image. The generated HR faces in return are used to optimize our decoder to reduce the domain gap. By iteratively updating the latent representations and our decoder, our DAP-FSR will be adapted to the target domain, thus achieving authentic and high-quality upsampled HR faces. Extensive experiments on three newly constructed benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superior performance of our proposed DAP-FSR compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

The ambiguous boundary between different semantic parts and those categories with similar appearance usually are confusing, leading to unexpected noises in ground truth masks. To tackle the problem of learning with label noises, this work introduces a purification strategy, called Self-Correction for Human Parsing (SCHP), to progressively promote the reliability of the supervised labels as well as the learned models. In particular, starting from a model trained with inaccurate annotations as initialization, we design a cyclically learning scheduler to infer more reliable pseudo-masks by iteratively aggregating the current learned model with the former optimal one in an online manner. Besides, those correspondingly corrected labels can in turn to further boost the model performance. In this way, the models and the labels will reciprocally become more robust and accurate during the self-correction learning cycles. Benefiting from the superiority of SCHP, we achieve the best performance on two popular single-person human parsing benchmarks, including LIP and Pascal-Person-Part datasets.

Previous practice [1] proposed to train the classifiers for unseen categories using the visual features generated from semantic word embeddings. However, the generator is merely learned on the seen categories while no constraint is applied to the unseen categories, leading to poor generalization ability. In this work, we propose a Consistent Structural Relation Learning (CSRL) approach to constrain the generating of unseen visual features by exploiting the structural relations between seen and unseen categories. We observe that different categories are usually with similar relations in either semantic word embedding space or visual feature space. This observation motivates us to harness the similarity of category-level relations on the semantic word embedding space to learn a better visual feature generator. Concretely, by exploring the pair-wise and list-wise structures, we impose the relations of generated visual features to be consistent with their counterparts in the semantic word embedding space. In this way, the relations between seen and unseen categories will be transferred to implicitly constrain the generator to produce relation-consistent unseen visual features. We conduct extensive experiments on Pascal-VOC and Pascal-Context benchmarks. The proposed CSRL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, resulting in ~7-12% on Pascal-VOC and ~2-5% on Pascal-Context.

Our mission is to study a generalizable and robust segmentation network from the meta-learning perspective so that both seen and unseen categories can be correctly recognized. Different from previous practices, this task performs segmentation on a joint label space consisting of both previously seen and novel categories. Moreover, pixels from these multiple categories need to be simultaneously taken into account, which is actually not well explored before. Accordingly, we present Meta Parsing Networks (MPNet) to better exploit the guidance information in the support set. Our MPNet contains two basic modules, i.e., the Adaptive Deep Metric Learning (ADML) module and the Contrastive Inter-class Distraction (CID) module. Specially, the ADML takes the annotated pixels from the support image as the guidance and adaptively produces high-quality prototypes for learning a deep comparison metric. In addition, MPNet further introduces the CID module learning to enlarge the feature discrepancy of different categories in the embedding space, leading the MPNet to generate more discriminative feature embeddings.

Given the resource-aware constraint (e.g., latency time), we optimize our network with network architecture search while considering the relationships among atomic operators, network depth and feature resolution in segmentation tasks. Since MRMS embeds the segmentation-specific knowledge, it also provides better architecture search space.

We proposed a novel SPHP(Single Person Human Parsing) network, which consists of three key modules to learn for parsing in an end-to-end manner including high resolution embedding module, global context embedding module and edge perceiving module.\n  Single Person Parsing Visualization    Multiple Person Parsing Visualization    Video Multiple Person Parsing Visualization   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601079773,"objectID":"77e35d9fb208659a988c4f9f76cb932d","permalink":"https://peikeli.github.io/competitions/cvpr2019-lip-challenge/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/competitions/cvpr2019-lip-challenge/","section":"competitions","summary":":trophy:Winner of single-person human parsing (Track1), multi-person human parsing (Track3) and multi-person video human parsing (Track4).","tags":["Competition"],"title":"CVPR2019 LIP Challenge 1st Place","type":"competitions"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601079773,"objectID":"73c43e7c32a094f1e5e7e420d4e1dec8","permalink":"https://peikeli.github.io/competitions/iccv2019-youtube-vos-challenge/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/competitions/iccv2019-youtube-vos-challenge/","section":"competitions","summary":":trophy:Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (Track 1) \u0026 Video Instance Segmentation Task (Track 2)","tags":["Competition"],"title":"ICCV2019 Youtube-VOS Challenge 3rd Place","type":"competitions"}]
